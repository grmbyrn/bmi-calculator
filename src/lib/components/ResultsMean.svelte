		<h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
		<p>
			A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may
			lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2
			diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample
			fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30
			minutes daily for five days a week.
